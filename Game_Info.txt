[THIS IS THE DEMO FOR SPRINT 1, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL ELEMENTS.]

THE WUMPUS LIVES IN A CAVE OF 8 ROOMS. EACH ROOM HAS THREE TUNNELS LEADING TO OTHER ROOMS. (THINK OF A DODECAHEDRON)
EACH ROOM IS CONNECTED TO THREE OTHER ROOMS WHICH YOU CAN ACCESS THROUGH THE CONNECTED TUBES.

-HAZARDS
BOTTOMLESS PITS: TWO ROOMS IN THE CAVE HAVE PIT IN THEM, WHEN YOU ENTER IN SUCH A ROOM YOU WILL FALL, DIE AND LOSE.
WUMPUS: THE WUMPUS IS NOT BOTHERED BY HAZARDS, HOWEVER IF YOU ENTER THE SAME ROOM AS WUMPUS YOU WILL BE EATEN.

-ABILITIES
TURN: ON EACH TURN YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO EITHER MOVE OR SHOOT AN ARROW.
MOVE: YOU CAN MOVE TO A CONNECTED ROOM THROUGH A TUNNEL.
SHOOT: YOU HAVE FIVE ARROW TO SHOOT (IF YOU RUN OUT THEN YOU LOSE). AN ARROW CAN MOVE THROUGH ONE TO FIVE ROOMS. IF THE ARROW HITS THE WUMPUS THEN YOU'LL WIN, HOWEVER IF YOU HIT YOURSELF YOU DIE AND LOSE.
SENSE: WHENEVER YOU ARE ONE ROOM AWAY FROM THE WUMPUS OR A HAZARD, YOU CAN SENSE ITS PRESENCE.

BEST OF LUCK
