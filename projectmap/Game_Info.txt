[THIS IS THE DEMO FOR SPRINT 2, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL FUNCTIONS YET]

THE WUMPUS LIVES IN A CAVE OF 20 ROOMS. EACH ROOM HAS THREE TUNNELS LEADING TO OTHER ROOMS. (THINK OF A DODECAHEDRON)
EACH ROOM IS CONNECTED TO THREE OTHER ROOMS WHICH YOU CAN ACCESS THROUGH THE CONNECTED TUBES.

-HAZARDS
BOTTOMLESS PITS: TWO ROOMS IN THE CAVE HAVE A PIT IN THEM, WHEN YOU ENTER IN SUCH A ROOM YOU WILL FALL, DIE AND LOSE.
WUMPUS: THE WUMPUS IS NOT BOTHERED BY HAZARDS, HOWEVER IF YOU ENTER THE SAME ROOM AS WUMPUS YOU WILL BE EATEN.
BATS: THE BATS IN THIS CAVE WILL PICK YOU UP IF YOU ENTER THE SAME ROOM AS THEM, ONCE THAT HAPPENS THE BATS WILL DROP YOU IN A RANDOM ROOM.

-ABILITIES
TURN: ON EACH TURN YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO EITHER MOVE OR SHOOT AN ARROW.
MOVE: YOU CAN MOVE TO A CONNECTED ROOM THROUGH A TUNNEL.
SENSE: WHENEVER YOU ARE TWO ROOMS AWAY FROM THE WUMPUS OR A HAZARD, YOU CAN SENSE ITS PRESENCE.

AT THE BEGINNING YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN NORMAL- AND CUSTOM MODE.
NORMAL MODE IS THE DEFAULT GAME MODE IN WHICH YOU GENERATE A NEW CAVE
CUSTOM MODE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REPLAY THE GENERATED MAP CURRENTLY SAVED IN THE MAP.TXT FILE.

AT THE END OF THE GAME YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRINT OUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENTLY PLAYED ROUND

BEST OF LUCK
